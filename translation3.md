Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Erechtheus, the son of Pandion, had four daughters.
At that time, Eumolpus, the son of Neptune, came to attack Athens, but was defeated. 
Neptune, angry because the son was killed by Erechtheus, said " Erechtheus was to sacrfice a daughter."
Therefore, Chthonia, the first daughter, was sacrificed.
The other sisters killed themselves; 
Erechtheus himself was hit by lightning.
