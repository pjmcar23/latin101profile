## Final Translation

Prometheus ignem ē deīs capiēbat. **1) Use the preposition *a/ab* rather than *e/ex* to express the idea of taking away *from* the gods. 2)  Why did you choose imperfect rather than perfect tense for your verb?**
Ipse ignī omnēs hominēs dabat.  **1) What case is *igni*?  2) Did you deliberately choose imperfect rather than perfect tense?**
Prometheus a deīs punītus est.
Aquila Prometheum cor oppunavit. **1) What case is *Prometheus*?  2) A better verb from your vocabulary list would be *peto, petere, petivi, petitus*.  Can you change your sentence to use it instead of *oppugno*?**
Illam Hercules interfēcīt.
