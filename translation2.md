## **Translation:**

Long ago Prometheus fashioned Lapetus, the first son of man, out of mud.
At the same time, Vulcanus made a woman out of mud.
Minerva gave the soul of this woman and sent her as a gift for all the gods.
Because of this, her name was Pandora.
Pandora was given in marriage to Epimetheus from Jupiter.
Their daughter, Pyrrha, was the first mortal.
