## C. Translation

When the Greeks were unable to seize Troy after ten years, Epeus made a wood horse of amazing size.
Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus had gathered in it. 
And on the horse wrote "GIFT GIVEN TO MINERVA BY THE GREEKS". 
When Trioanus saw it, 
they judged the enemy to go away; 
Priamus commanded that the horse be lead into the temple of Minerva.  
When the prophet, Cassandra, said 
"the horse has ememies", no faith was given to her and placed the horse in front of the temple. 
The Greeks went out to the gates and killed the guards and conquered Troy.
