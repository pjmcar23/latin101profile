## C. Translation

When the Greeks were unable to seize Troy after ten years, Epeus made a wood horse of amazing size.
Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus were to gather in it.
And written on the horse was "GIFT GIVEN TO MINERVA BY THE GREEKS".
When Troy saw it, they judged that the enemy went away; Priamus commanded that the horse be lead into the temple of Minerva.  
When the prophet, Cassandra, spoke the horse had ememies, no faith was given to her and the horse was placed in front of the temple.
The Greeks went out and killed the guards of the gates and conquered Troy.
