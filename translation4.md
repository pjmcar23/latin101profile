3. Explain the sentence structure of DANAI MINERVAE DONUM DANT?

   The subject is DANAI (the Greeks; nom. pl.), the main verb is DANT (to give; present, active, 3rd  person, pl. indicative), DONUM (gift; acc. sg.) is the direct object that receives the direct impact, and MINERVAE (Minerva; dat. sg.) is the indirect object that is subject to the impact in an indirect way. Therefore, this is a Transitive active sentence.

5. What kind of grammatical construction do we have in the sentence Priamus imperavit equum in templum Minervae duci?
Identify its constituent parts.

   An independent clause (Priamus imperavit) and a dependent clause (equum in templum Minervae duci).

   duci => Verb of dependent clause

6. Parse duci.

   present, infinitive, passive.

7. What case is ei and what role is it playing in the sentence?

8. What is the function of the que in portārumque?

   It works as a conjunction meaning 'and'.
